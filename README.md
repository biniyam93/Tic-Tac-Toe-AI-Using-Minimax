# Tic-Tac-Toe AI Using Minimax

## Description:

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe AI project, a Python-based implementation of an AI player utilizing the Minimax algorithm to play Tic-Tac-Toe optimally. This project enables users to play Tic-Tac-Toe against an AI opponent that makes optimal moves.

## Project Overview:

* `tic_tac_toe.py`: This is the main Python script implementing the Tic-Tac-Toe game and the Minimax algorithm for AI gameplay. It encompasses key functionalities such as generating possible moves, determining game results, and implementing the Minimax algorithm for optimal decision-making.
* `README.md`: This documentation file providing an overview of the project, its features, and instructions on how to use it.

## Features:

#### 1. Player Actions
  * The `player` module defines actions for the human player and the AI player, enabling them to make moves on the Tic-Tac-Toe board.

#### 2. Game Result
  * The `result` module determines the result of the game, whether it's a win, loss, or draw.

#### 3. Winner Determination
  * The `winner` module checks for the winner of the Tic-Tac-Toe game, if any player has achieved a winning configuration.

#### 4. Terminal State
  * The `terminal` module identifies terminal states in the game, indicating whether the game has ended in a win, loss, or draw.

#### 5. Utility Calculation
  * The `utility` module calculates the utility value of terminal game states, assigning scores based on the outcome of the game.

#### 6. Minimax Algorithm
  * The `minimax` module implements the Minimax algorithm for decision-making, enabling the AI player to choose optimal moves based on game states.

## How to Use:

1. **Run the Script**: Execute the `tic_tac_toe.py` script in a Python environment.

2. **Play Against the AI**: Follow the on-screen prompts to play Tic-Tac-Toe against the AI opponent. The AI will make optimal moves using the Minimax algorithm.

3. **Enjoy the Game**: Experience the challenge of playing against an AI that plays Tic-Tac-Toe optimally, making it a fun and engaging experience.

## Design Choices:

**Minimax Algorithm**: The Minimax algorithm was chosen for its effectiveness in decision-making for zero-sum games like Tic-Tac-Toe. It ensures that the AI player makes optimal moves to maximize its chances of winning or achieving a draw.

**Modular Design**: The project is designed with modularity in mind, with separate modules for different aspects of the game such as player actions, game result determination, and the Minimax algorithm. This enhances readability, maintainability, and extensibility of the codebase.

**Console Interface**: The game interaction is console-based, providing a simple and intuitive interface for users to play against the AI. This design choice ensures compatibility across different platforms and ease of use.
